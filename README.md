# Playlist-Timer-Generator
With a certain time inputted, the program will output a playlist that will be the desired time length using bin-packing algorithms. The program can also create a random playlist with random artists at a random length of time for the user. If the user desires, they can open the playlist in Spotify. This may have many uses, for example, one can use the playlist outputted as a music timer.
